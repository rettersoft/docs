Projects are the applications that you run on your Rio operating system.
Each project lives in its own sandbox and cannot access other projects' resources.

Each project is given an unique projectId upon creation. This cannot be changed later.

You can create a project on the developer console as well as running the following command via the Rio CLI.

> rio init {project-name}
